# Kiev.Impressions
Project

**Kyiv** is the city, that deserves to be loved perhaps more than any other city in Ukraine. But (*such a pity*) most of the capital citizens prefer to spend their spare time in lots of small caffees or simply at home, watching tv. In this case the city obviously looks for them like an intimidating beton monster with constant corks and moody faces surrounding them.
This project is organized in order to make everyone understand, that Kyiv is a wonderful city, that consists of beautiful parks, fascinating places and interesting happenings.
It is planed to create a website that helps its users to choose from the great number of activities, compare the alternatives and find here what is really needed to have a great time in this admirable city.
